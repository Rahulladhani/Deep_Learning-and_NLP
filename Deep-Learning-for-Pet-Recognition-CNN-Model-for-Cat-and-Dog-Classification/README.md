# Deep-Learning-for-Pet-Recognition-CNN-Model-for-Cat-and-Dog-Classification
CNN Model Summary:

This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model implemented using TensorFlow and Keras for image classification tasks, specifically focusing on distinguishing between images of cats and dogs. The model is designed to learn and recognize intricate patterns in images, leveraging the power of deep learning for accurate classification.

Key Features:

Data Preprocessing: Prior to training, the model preprocesses both the training and test datasets using a variety of techniques such as rescaling, shearing, zooming, and horizontal flipping. These transformations are applied to augment the data and improve the model's ability to generalize to unseen images.

Architecture: The CNN architecture is carefully crafted to effectively extract hierarchical features from the input images. It consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction. Additionally, fully connected dense layers are incorporated towards the end of the network for classification purposes.

Training and Evaluation: The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function. During training, the model iterates over multiple epochs, gradually adjusting its parameters to minimize the prediction error on the training data. Subsequently, the model's performance is evaluated on a separate test dataset to assess its ability to generalize to unseen images. Metrics such as accuracy are computed to quantify the model's effectiveness.

Prediction: Once trained, the model can make predictions on individual images, allowing users to input their own images and obtain predictions on whether they contain a cat or a dog. This functionality is particularly useful for real-world applications where automated image classification is required.

Note: The dataset  is too big, which I am unable to upload. You will find the dataset from kaggle.
